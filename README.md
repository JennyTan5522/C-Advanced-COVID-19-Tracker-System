COVID-19 Contact-Tracking System
The  Contact-Tracking System is widely used across College to ensure the safety of students and staff. Complying with government regulations, the system requires everyone to check in and out when visiting a place, helping track movements in case of contact with COVID-19 patients. 
It is essential in high-risk areas, collecting information like address, email, phone number, purpose of visit, check-in venue, temperature, and current status.

The system features auto-saving data, eliminating the need for manual entry during check-ins or check-outs. 
Only admins have access to the data, allowing them to add, update, modify, or delete records, ensuring the privacy and security of personal information.
